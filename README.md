 Accounting System Automation

Project Overview:
A local retail business, dealing with a variety of products, aims to streamline and automate its accounting procedures. The business operates two shifts per day with one worker on each shift. The primary goal is to create a Python project that assists in automating essential accounting tasks, including calculating total sales, worker salaries, profit, tips, and total tips for the day.

Key Features:

Calculate Total Sales for the Day: from sales data for morning and evening shifts, produce total sales for the day. Calculate Worker’s Salary: given hourly rate and hours worked by a worker. retrieve the worker’s salary. Calculate Profit: given a list of numbers representing total sales and total cost of items sold, find the profit.(or loss if negative) Calculate Tips for a Shift: from sales data for a specific shift, workers get tipped for the shift (2% of shift sales). Calculate Total Tips for the Day: with sales data for morning and evening shifts, return total tips for the day (sum of tips from both shifts). Think of your shift sales as a list.

User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface that displays a menu of available operations. Accept user input to choose the desired operation (1-5) or exit (6). Input Handling: Prompt the user to enter numbers for each operation. Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric inputs). Result Display: Display the result of the selected operation clearly to the user. Program Loop: Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations until choosing to exit. Project Structure: Organize your code into functions to encapsulate specific operations. Maintain a clear separation between function definitions and the main program. Error Handling: Include error handling for scenarios such as division by zero. Exiting the Program: Provide an option for users to exit the program.
